Failure to provide all such information to the person subject to the adverse decision shall be a misdemeanor [O.C.G.A.ยง35-3-34\(b\) and ยง35-3- 35\(b\)]\.\n\n  You have the right to expect the agency receiving the results of the criminal history record check will use it only for authorized purposes and will not retain or disseminate it in violation of state and/or federal statute, regulation or executive order, or rule, procedure or standard established by the National Crime Prevention and Privacy Compact Council\.\n\n \# Privacy Act \#\n Authority: The FBI's acquisition, preservation, and exchange of fingerprints and associated information is generally authorized under 28 U\.S\.\C. 534\. Depending on the nature of your application, supplemental authorities include Federal statutes, State statutes pursuant to Pub\. L\. 92-544, Presidential Executive Orders, and federal regulations\. Providing your fingerprints and associated information is voluntary; however, failure to do so may affect completion or approval of your application\.\n\n Principal Purpose: Certain determinations, such as employment, licensing, and security clearances, may be predicated on fingerprint-based background checks\. Your fingerprints and associated information/biometrics may be provided to the employing, investigating, or otherwise responsible agency, and/or the FBI for the purpose of comparing your fingerprints to other fingerprints in the FBI's Next Generation Identification \(NG\I) system or its successor systems \(including civil, criminal, and latent fingerprint repositories\) or other available records of the employing, investigating, or otherwise responsible agency\. The FBI may retain your fingerprints and associated information/biometrics in NGI after the completion of this application and, while retained, your fingerprints may continue to be compared against other fingerprints submitted to or retained by NGI\.\n\n Routine Uses: During the processing of this application and for as long thereafter as your fingerprints and associated information/biometrics are retained in NGI, your information may be disclosed pursuant to your consent, and may be disclosed without your consent as permitted by the Privacy Act of 1974 and all applicable Routine Uses as may be published at any time in the Federal Register, including the Routine Uses for the NGI system and the FBI's Blanket Routine Uses\. Routine uses include, but are not limited to, disclosures to: employing, governmental or authorized non-governmental agencies responsible for employment, contracting, licensing, security clearances, and other suitability determinations; local, state, tribal, or federal law enforcement agencies; criminal justice agencies; and agencies responsible for national security or public safety\.\n";
